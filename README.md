*PROBLEM STATEMENT:
DA-IICT Club Manager:
You need to build a manager for all the DA-IICT clubs. 
The manager ensures that a club member can be looked up in minimum time. 
A member can either be a faculty or a student. 
One should be able to search by name, ID, specific club name, or club category (i.e., arts, science & technology, sports, culture). 
Note that the user of this manager may not be a  DA-IICT-ian and, therefore, may not know the clubsâ€™ names.
